Log Analysis Project 6/2/2018
=======================

Description
-----------------------

A project completed for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. 

In this project, I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects that I have and will complete throughout the course of my Nanodegree program.

This project helped me learn the fundamentals of responsive design and solidified my understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as giving me the opportunity to become familliar with the Bootstrap framework. Also, I now have an awesome website to showcase the projects I complete.
